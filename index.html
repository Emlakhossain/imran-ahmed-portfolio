            <h3>Build Climber and Train Stopper</h3>
            <p style="padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">You might saw me jumping, climbing
                buildings, and
                stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development Hero.</p>

            <h4>Become a web developer</h4>
            <p style="padding-right: 70px; text-align: justify;">I already learned the basic HTML
                and CSS. I can build
                any simple website. I
                can even teach my grandma how
                to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
